# Chrome Extension UI

I created this Chrome Extension UI as I was bored and created this small Project.
It is similar as making a Website, but it takes Additional manifest.json file which stores data related to chrome web store that will be used by chrome to identify as extension.
Also, you can take all the information of user (Not personal info obviously), their cookies, their tabs on chrome with help of manifest.json, But I only created a UI here.

I've not pulished it as there is a fee to register as a chrome web store developer.
But you can check out what I made in the link given in description of this repository.

PS: If you want to study the code, It will be very challenging. I will suggest creating the same in your code instead ;)
